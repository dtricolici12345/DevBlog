DevBlog was the fourth hackathon organized by WildCodeSchool, and it was my first solo participation! Over the course of two days, participants were required to develop a project from scratch, including the backend. My idea was to create a unique blog for programmers, where each user, upon authorization, could share their ideas, experiences, and projects.

DevBlog is not just a blog; it's a community of like-minded individuals where programmers can find inspiration, share knowledge, and network. In DevBlog, every user has full control over their publications: creating, editing, deleting, and viewing them â€” everything is easy and intuitive.

Join DevBlog and become part of this exciting community of developers!
